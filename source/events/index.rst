IACT event lists
================

This document describes IACT DL3 event lists.

Event lists are stored in FITS files with two required and one optional
extensions (HDUs).

* Suggested filename: ``events_OBS_ID.fits.gz``
* Suggested HDU name events: ``EVENTS``
* Suggested HDU name good time intervals: ``GTI``
* Suggested HDU name telescope array: ``TELARRAY``

EVENTS extension
----------------

The first extension contains characteristic information about each event.
Suggested extension name ``EVENTS``. These information are stored in a FITS
binary table. The columns are listed below. In addition, a list of header
keywords to be contained in each FITS event list is also documented. Many of the
keywords are not necessarily required for an analysis. The information is,
however, included as meta data in the event lists to enable instrument-dependent
studies and selections of particular observations.

Required columns
----------------

* ``EVENT_ID`` type: int
    * Event identification number at the DL3 level
      (lower data levels could be different, see note below).
    * Required: The pair (``OBS_ID``, ```EVENT_ID``) must be globally unique
      for all events from a given instrument.
      (to be discussed ... it's not clear if CTA will have "runs" ``OBS_ID``)
    * Required: ``EVENT_ID`` should increase monotonically with ``TIME``.
      (to be discussed if this should be changed to a recommendation only)
    * Required: event lists should be sorted by ``EVENT_ID`` and ``TIME``.
      (to be discussed if this should be changed to a recommendation only)
* ``TIME`` type: double, unit: s
    * Time stamp of event in MET
* ``RA`` type: float, unit: deg
    * Event right ascension (see :ref:`sky-coordinates-radec`)
* ``DEC`` type: float, unit: deg
    * Event declination (see :ref:`sky-coordinates-radec`)
* ``ENERGY`` type: float, unit: TeV
    * Reconstructed event energy

Notes on EVENT_ID
-----------------

This paragraph contains some explanatory notes concerning the requirements
and recommendations on ``EVENT_ID``.

Most analyses with high-level science tools don't need ``EVENT_ID`` information.
But being able to uniquely identify every event is important, e.g. when
comparing the high-level reconstructed event parameters (``RA``, ``DEC``,
``ENERGY``) for different calibrations, reconstructions or gamma-hadron
separations.

Assigning a unique ``EVENT_ID`` during data taking can be difficult or
impossible. E.g. in H.E.S.S. we have two numbers ``BUNCH_ID_HESS`` and
``EVENT_ID_HESS`` that only together uniquely identify an event within a given
run (i.e. ``OBS_ID``). Probably the scheme to uniquely identify events at the
DL0 level for CTA will be even more complicated, because of the much larger
number of telescopes and events.

So given that data taking and event identification is different for every IACT
at low data levels and is already fixed for existing IACTs, we propose here
to have an ``EVENT_ID`` that is simpler and works the same for all IACTs at
the DL3 level.

Hello world!

As an example: for H.E.S.S. we achive this by using an INT64 for ``EVENT_ID``
and to store ``EVENT_ID = (BUNCH_ID_HESS << 32) || (EVENT_ID_HESS)``, i.e.
use the upper bits to contain the low-level bunch ID and the lower bits
to contains the low-level event ID.
This encoding is unique and reversible, i.e. it's easy to go back to
``BUNCH_ID_HESS`` and ``EVENT_ID_HESS`` for a given ``EVENT_ID``,
and to low-level checks (e.g. look at the shower images for a given event
that behaves strangely in reconstructed high-level parameters).

.. _iact-gti:

GTI extension
-------------

Each event list file contains an extension to specify the good time intervals
('GTIs'). A general description of GTIs can be found in the `OGIP GTI`_
standard. This HDU contains two columns named START and STOP. At least one row
is containing the start and end time of the observation must be present. The
values are in units of seconds with respect to the reference time defined in the
associated header (keywords MJDREFI and MJDREFF). This extension allows for a
detailed handling of good time intervals (i.e. excluding periods with cloud
cover or lightning during one observation). Eventually, this extension could
disappear from the required extensions. High-level Science tools could add the
GTIs to the files according to user parameter. See e.g. `gtmktime`_ for an
application example from the Fermi Science Tools. The column names and FITS
header keywords are documented in the following, respectively.

GTI Column Names
----------------

* ``START`` type: double, unit: s
    * Start time of good time interval (observation)  [MET]
* ``STOP`` type: double, unit: s
    * End time of good time interval (observation) [MET]
    
GTI Header Keywords
-------------------

* ``MJDREFI`` type: int, unit: days
    * Integer part of MJD time reference
* ``MJDREFF`` type: float, unit: days
