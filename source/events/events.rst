EVENTS extension
----------------

The first extension is a binary FITS table that contains an event list.
Each row of the table provides information that characterises one event.
The mandatory and optional columns of the table are listed below. In
addition, a list of header keywords providing metadata is specified.
Also here there are mandatory and optional keywords.
The suggested extension name of the binary table is ``EVENTS``.

Mandatory Header keywords:
--------------------------

* ``ORIGIN`` type: string
    * Organisation that created the FITS file.
* ``CREATOR`` type: string
    * Software that created the file.
      When appropriate, the value of the CREATOR keyword should also reference the specific
      version of the program that created the FITS file.
      It is intented that this keyword should refer to the program that originally defined the
      FITS file structure and wrote the contents. If a FITS file is subsequently copied largely
      intact into a new FITS by another program, then the value of the CREATOR keyword should
      still refer to the original program. ``HISTORY`` keywords should be used instead to document
      any further processing that is performed on the file after it is created.

Notes on EVENT_ID
-----------------

This paragraph contains some explanatory notes concerning the requirements
and recommendations on ``EVENT_ID``.

Most analyses with high-level science tools don't need ``EVENT_ID`` information.
But being able to uniquely identify every event is important, e.g. when
comparing the high-level reconstructed event parameters (``RA``, ``DEC``,
``ENERGY``) for different calibrations, reconstructions or gamma-hadron
separations.

Assigning a unique ``EVENT_ID`` during data taking can be difficult or
impossible. E.g. in H.E.S.S. we have two numbers ``BUNCH_ID_HESS`` and
``EVENT_ID_HESS`` that only together uniquely identify an event within a given
run (i.e. ``OBS_ID``). Probably the scheme to uniquely identify events at the
DL0 level for CTA will be even more complicated, because of the much larger
number of telescopes and events.

So given that data taking and event identification is different for every IACT
at low data levels and is already fixed for existing IACTs, we propose here
to have an ``EVENT_ID`` that is simpler and works the same for all IACTs at
the DL3 level.

As an example: for H.E.S.S. we achive this by using an INT64 for ``EVENT_ID``
and to store ``EVENT_ID = (BUNCH_ID_HESS << 32) || (EVENT_ID_HESS)``, i.e.
use the upper bits to contain the low-level bunch ID and the lower bits
to contains the low-level event ID.
This encoding is unique and reversible, i.e. it's easy to go back to
``BUNCH_ID_HESS`` and ``EVENT_ID_HESS`` for a given ``EVENT_ID``,
and to low-level checks (e.g. look at the shower images for a given event
that behaves strangely in reconstructed high-level parameters).
