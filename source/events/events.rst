EVENTS
======

The ``EVENTS`` extension is a binary FITS table that contains an event list.
Each row of the table provides information that characterises one event.
The mandatory and optional columns of the table are listed below. In
addition, a list of header keywords providing metadata is specified.
Also here there are mandatory and optional keywords.
The recommended extension name of the binary table is ``EVENTS``.

      should refer to the program that originally defined the FITS file
      structure and wrote the contents. If a FITS file is subsequently
      copied largely intact into a new FITS by another program, then the value
      of the ``CREATOR`` keyword should still refer to the original program.
      ``HISTORY`` keywords should be used instead to document any further
      processing that is performed on the file after it is created.

      `here <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/ofwg/docs/ofwg_recomm/r7.html>`_.

Notes
-----

This paragraph contains some explanatory notes on some of the columns
and header keys mentioned above.

.. _iact-events-event-id:

EVENT_ID
~~~~~~~~

Most analyses with high-level science tools don't need ``EVENT_ID`` information.
But being able to uniquely identify every event is important, e.g. when
comparing the high-level reconstructed event parameters (``RA``, ``DEC``,
``ENERGY``) for different calibrations, reconstructions or gamma-hadron
separations.

Assigning a unique ``EVENT_ID`` during data taking can be difficult or
impossible. E.g. in H.E.S.S. we have two numbers ``BUNCH_ID_HESS`` and
``EVENT_ID_HESS`` that only together uniquely identify an event within a given
run (i.e. ``OBS_ID``). Probably the scheme to uniquely identify events at the
DL0 level for CTA will be even more complicated, because of the much larger
number of telescopes and events.

So given that data taking and event identification is different for every IACT
at low data levels and is already fixed for existing IACTs, we propose here to
have an ``EVENT_ID`` that is simpler and works the same for all IACTs at the DL3
level.

As an example: for H.E.S.S. we achieve this by using an INT64 for ``EVENT_ID``
and to store ``EVENT_ID = (BUNCH_ID_HESS << 32) | (EVENT_ID_HESS)``, i.e. use
the upper bits to contain the low-level bunch ID and the lower bits to contains
the low-level event ID. This encoding is unique and reversible, i.e. it's easy
to go back to ``BUNCH_ID_HESS`` and ``EVENT_ID_HESS`` for a given ``EVENT_ID``,
and to low-level checks (e.g. look at the shower images for a given event that
behaves strangely in reconstructed high-level parameters).

.. _iact-events-class-type:

EV_CLASS and EVENT_TYPE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently in this format specification, event class ``EV_CLASS`` is a header key
(i.e. the same for all events in a given event list) and ``EVENT_TYPE`` is a
bitfield column (i.e. can have a different value for each event). Both are
optional at this time, only used as provenance information, not by science tools
to make any decisions how to analyse the data.

The reason for this is simply that we have not agreed yet on a scheme what event
class and event type means, and how it should be used by science tools for
analysis. Developing this will be one of the major topics for the next version
of the spec. It is likely that a proper definition of event classes and types
will not be compatible with what is currently defined here, so not filling
``EV_CLASS`` and ``EVENT_TYPE`` when creating DL3 data is not a bad idea.

To summarise a bit the discussions on this important point in the past years,
they were mostly done by looking at what Fermi-LAT is doing and some
prototyping in H.E.S.S. to export DL3 data to FITS.

The scheme in Fermi-LAT for event classes and event types is nicely summarised
`here
<https://github.com/gammapy/PyGamma15/blob/gh-pages/talks/fermi2/fermi_advanced_v0.pdf>`__
or `here
<https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/documentation/Cicerone/Cicerone_Data/LAT_DP.html>`__.
There event classes and types are key parts of the data model, used for EVENT to
IRF association and even end users need to learn about them and pass event class
and type information when using science tools.

One option could be to mostly adopt what Fermi-LAT does for IACTs. However, a
major difference is that Fermi-LAT is a more stable detector, that has a CALDB
of a very limited number or IRFs that can be used for all data, whereas for
IACTs with changing telescope configurations, degrading mirrors, changing
atmosphere, zenith angle, ... most likely we will have to produce per-observation
IRFs, and then it's easier to bundle the IRFs with the EVENTS in one file,
and the use of event class and type to link EVENTS and IRFs is no longer needed.

An alternative scheme is to use the term "event class" to describe a given
analysis configuration. This is e.g. how we currently use ``EV_CLASS`` in
H.E.S.S., we fill values like "standard" or "hard" or "loose" to describe a
given full configuration that is the result of a calibration, event
reconstruction and gamma-hadron separation pipeline. This is similar to what
Fermi-LAT does, except less sophisticated, the event classes are completely
independent, there is no nesting, and separate events and IRF files are produced
for each class/configuration. To analyse data from a given class, the user
chooses which set of files to download (e.g. "loose" for pulsars or "hard" for a
bright source where a good PSF is needed), and then the science tools don't need
to do anything with ``EV_CLASS``, it is just provenance information. Some people
are experimenting with the use of ``EVENT_TYPE`` in a similar way as Fermi-LAT,
e.g. to have event quality partitioning based on number of telescopes that saw a
given event, or other criteria. Again, it is left to users to split events by
``EVENT_TYPE`` and produce IRFs for each event type and pass those for a joint
fit to the science tools, as there is no agreement or implementation yet in the
science tools to support ``EVENT_TYPE`` directly.

So to conclude and summarise again: ``EV_CLASS`` and ``EVENT_TYPE`` as mentioned
here in this spec are optional and very preliminary. Defining event class and
type for IACTs needs more prototyping by the science tools and current IACTs and
CTA and discussion, and then a proposal for a specification.

.. _iact-events-obs-mode:

OBS_MODE
~~~~~~~~

The keyword ``OBS_MODE`` specifies the mode of the observation.
This is used in cases where the instrument or detector can be configured to
operate in different modes which significantly affect the resulting data, or to accomodate
different types of instrument. More details can be found
`here <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/ofwg/docs/general/ogip_94_001/ogip_94_001.html>`__

In addition to the OGIP-defined values (``POINTING``, ``RASTER``, ``SLEW`` and ``SCAN``), we
define the option ``DRIFT`` to accomodate ground-based wide-field instruments, in
which local zenith/azimuth coordinates remain constant. In this case, the header keywords
``RA_PNT`` and ``DEC_PNT`` are no longer mandatory, and instead ``ALT_PNT`` and ``AZ_PNT``
are required.

It is likely that ``OBS_MODE`` in the future will be a key piece of information
in the DL3 data model, defining the observation mode (e.g. pointed, divergent,
slewing, ...) and being required to analyse the data correctly.
